## Optimizations

Merged all the data fetched from both api's about [ MovieDetails CastDetails ]
### From this
- Movie Details
    - image_path
    - title
    - realease_data
    - genres
    - runtime
    - user_rating
    - overview

- Cast Details
    - original_name
    - character
    - image_path

      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- After merging the data looping over them got simplified. Thus resulting in lesser complexity of the backend.
- Also only one prop was being sent to the frontend i.e "finalRecommendation" which contained all the data about 5 recommended movies.
